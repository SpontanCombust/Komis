# NOTICE
Widgets widget directory are split into: interface (optional) and implementation (mandatory).
- Interfaces directories contain files created through the use of wxWidgets Rapid Application Development tools. If you want to edit any of these dialog/frame classes make sure the implementation won't break because of it. 
- Implementation directories contain source files that use the interface and implement its behaviours (button event handlers etc.).
